# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
Detected: UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce
An SSH brute force attack was detected on the Web Service Instance - C3, originating from Instance - C3. 
These types of attacks attempt to gain unauthorized access by repeatedly guessing the SSH password.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
According to the AWS GuardDuty documentation, 
GuardDuty detects unauthorized and unusual activity by analyzing data from several sources, 
including AWS CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs. 
The logs are encrypted during transit and then analyzed by GuardDuty for profiling and anomaly detection. 
In this case, the attack was likely detected using data from the VPC Flow Logs, 
which track network traffic to and from EC2 instances, 
helping to identify patterns indicative of a brute force attack.
