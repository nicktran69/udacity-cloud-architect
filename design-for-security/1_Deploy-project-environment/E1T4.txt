Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The IAM Role (InstanceRole) has unrestricted access to all S3 buckets. 
This violates the principle of least privilege, as roles should be tailored to specific resources and actions to limit unnecessary permissions.

# Poor practice 2
The WebAppSG security group allows inbound traffic from the internet on multiple ports (including 22, 5000, and 80), 
which increases the risk of attacks. 
Additionally, it permits unrestricted outbound traffic to any IP address, further exposing the server to potential vulnerabilities.
