Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
1. Load Balancer Security: The Load Balancer lacks HTTP to HTTPS redirection.
2. VPC Security Groups: Security groups are configured to allow unrestricted ingress and egress traffic, violating AWS security best practices.
3. Exposed Ports: TCP port 5000 on the EC2 instance is accessible from the internet, which poses a security risk.
4. S3 Security: Server-side encryption and logging are not enabled for S3 buckets.
5. IAM Policy: The IAM policy does not adhere to the principle of least privilege, allowing excessive access to resources.
6. Root Account Usage: The system does not enforce the use of a non-root account.
7. CloudTrail Configuration: A CloudTrail for logging activity is not set up.


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. IAM Policy Improvements: Enforce the use of non-root users, require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and set IAM policies with specific, least-privilege permissions.
2. CloudTrail Setup: Create and configure a CloudTrail to track account activity, with logs stored in an S3 bucket.
3. HTTPS Enforcement: Configure the Application Load Balancer to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS to ensure secure communication.
4. VPC Security Group Restrictions: Restrict security group rules to allow only necessary traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). Reference other security groups for internal VPC communication where necessary.
5. Port Restrictions on EC2: Disable access to unnecessary ports, such as TCP 5000, on the EC2 instance to reduce the attack surface.
6. S3 Security: Enable server-side encryption and logging for S3 buckets to ensure data is securely stored and monitored.
